## Top Ten Educational Youtube Channels: AN EDA

Established in 2005, YouTube has evolved into the second-largest search engine globally, trailing only behind Google, and boasts a staggering 3 billion monthly searches. The YouTube algorithm, responsible for video views and recommendations, is of the most sophisticated industrial recommendation systems in existence. Despite its prominence, the way it actually works is largely shrouded in mystery. This lack of transparency poses a significant challenge for aspiring content creators seeking to comprehend why certain videos gain traction while others struggle to do so. Various misconceptions surround the elements contributing to a video's popularity, such as the belief that more likes or comments guarantee success, or that specific video durations are key. Navigating these uncertainties becomes especially daunting for new content creators.

In this landscape, experimenting and identifying trends within specific niches become crucial strategies. Observing the topics gaining traction among YouTube channels can offer valuable insights for those looking to carve a niche and enhance their video visibility.

The scope of this small project is limited to educational channels and I will not consider other niches (that might have a different characteristics and audience base). Therefore, in this project will explore the statistics of around 10 most successful educational Youtube channels.
